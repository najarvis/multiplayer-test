# multiplayer-test

### A test in creating a multiplayer game using Python and Pygame.

Uses a basic client-server architecture, with UDP for the main protocol.
Also uses pickle and base64 to encode / decode data.

## Usage
`python main.py`

## Requirements
* Python 3 (I use 3.6.2 but I know it will work on earlier versions. Probably 3.2 is earliest)
* Pygame 1.9.2


## Future
I don't know, I can't tell you my future any more than I can tell you yours.

...but it would be pretty neat if I decided to make a little co-op game.
